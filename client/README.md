**Problem statement:** Traceability for Mango Farmers at Farm Didi - DAPP with Smart QR Code
Problem Statement: The farmers are forced to sell their produce to the nearby or influential and wealthy local aggregators in their village who fix the prices at their will. The farmer is not visible, nor is his voice heard in most commodity supply chains. The presence of toxins, pesticide residues, and low hygiene standards result in high export rejections, which again affect profitability.
